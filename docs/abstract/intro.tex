In recent years we have seen a great increase in networked multimedia
applications; many of them greatly prefer to use UDP for transmission because
the variability of TCP's congestion control mechanism and its complete
reliability do not match their timeliness requirements. These applications, such
as streaming media, Internet telephony, and games have in common two key demands
of a transport protocol:

\begin{itemize}

\item timely packet delivery
\item smooth predictable transmission rate

\end{itemize}

Proposed congestion control mechanisms to achieve these characteristics include
generalizations of TCP-like window-based schemes (e.g., GAIMD~\cite{YL00},
TEAR~\cite{ROY00}, Binomial TCP~\cite{BB01}) and equation-based congestion
control scheme (e.g., TFRC~\cite{FHPW00}).  In this work for GSoC 2008, we would
like to implement the latter cases: TFRC proposed by Floyd~\cite{FHPW00} and
TFWC proposed by Soo-Hyun~\cite{SH06} over VIC/RAT audio/video
applications~\cite{AVATS} using \textsf{C/C++}.
