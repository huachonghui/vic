\textsf{\textbf{why I am a strong candidate?}} Implementing a network protocol
can be sometimes challenging task as it is often hard to validate every function
in every aspect.  However, I already developed TFWC on ns-2 and know exact steps
how to develop such congestion control protocols.  Also, AVATS project is now
being conducted in the same department that I'm working on, and I know well the
PI and the main developer as we are just sitting next to each other.  My current
research is also based on the part of their software.  This could be a natural
adaptation for us to start co-working, meaning that we could achieve the goal in
a relatively short time scale with my experience, and it also could be easier to
co-work because we are geographically in the same place.
