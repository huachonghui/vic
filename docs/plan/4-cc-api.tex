In this section, we propose necessary CC APIs to put together with \emph{vic}
transmit modules. The first thing that came up is looking at the send thread in
UltraGrid (See Figure~\ref{fig:ultra-send} in Section~\ref{sssec:ultra-send}).
As we have briefly mentioned in Section~\ref{ssec:vic-overview}, we need to
implement a send buffer that can parse the parameters passed by the CC modules,
and also these parameters should be placed in RTP hearder.
