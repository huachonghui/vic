\subsection{\label{ssec:overview}Overview}

We have drawn a high-level overview \emph{vic} architecture (sender only) that
has congestion control modules as in Figure~\ref{fig:overview-arch}. This figure
represents a high-level overview of \emph{vic} so that we could see the major
components of the system, and how they are interacting with each other.

Unlike to the sender, we envisage the architecture of the receiver is relatively
simple. For example, upon a packet reception, it will be inserted to a receive
buffer, subsequently decoded (and some color conversion if necessary), and
finally displayed in a output device. Depending upon a codec, the rendered
frames may not be discareded immediately, but will be kept for some times before
they get purged.
